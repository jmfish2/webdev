          <h3>
            As the son of a father who was in the United States Airforce, Jason grew up all over the United States.
            His early life was constantly meeting new and interesting people. He learned early that the
            greatest gift in life is a conversation with a complete stranger, and that with just a
            little listening, everyone on this planet is connected.

             Jason wished to serve his country, so he joined the United States Navy. He trained and completed
             Naval Nuclear Power Training as a Reactor Operator. School was not easy, but he learned that
             persistence is a key factor to success as much as and more than raw talent.
